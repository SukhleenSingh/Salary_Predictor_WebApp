# Salary_Predictor_WebApp

Overview
Welcome to the Salary Predictor Web App repository! This project aims to provide users with a convenient platform to predict salaries based on experience levels using machine learning techniques. The web application is built using Python and various libraries, with a focus on Scikit-learn for implementing a linear regression model and Streamlit for deployment to a webpage.

Project Structure
The web application consists of three main pages:
1. Home Page:
• On the home page, users can explore the dataset and visualize key insights.
• Interactive visualizations allow users to gain a better understanding of the relationship between years of experience and salaries.
2. Prediction Page:
• The prediction page enables users to predict salaries based on the number of years of experience entered.
• Utilizing the linear regression model trained on the dataset, accurate salary predictions are generated in real-time.
3. Contribute Page:
• The contribute page encourages users to contribute data to our dataset, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of our prediction model.
• Clear guidelines are provided for users to submit their datasets, ensuring consistency and quality of contributed data.

• Technologies Used
